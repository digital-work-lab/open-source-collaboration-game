# Instructor preparation

- Print playbooks for maintainers (2x)
- After the repository was created (round 1): clearly display the link (write it on the blackboard) so that others can fork it
- After the first round: add a short break (optional) when some groups are behind and need help

- At the end: illustrate the difference between the merge commits / rebases / squashes

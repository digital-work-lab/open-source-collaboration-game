# Playbook C7 (R2): The fork

## Creating a fork

You understand why the maintainers have declined your suggestions, but you are still convinced that they should be implemented. You decide to conduct active development on your fork. To do this, merge your changes into the main branch of your fork. 

## Inviting others to contribute to your fork

Once the maintainers have completed their round, ask them to give you the stage (and beamer) for a few minutes.

- Explain to the contributors that you decide to pursue a separate fork because you believe that the data input should not be overly restricted.
- Show that you have merged your work.
- State that you plan to integrate changes from the main repository, but that you will go forward with the support of other data types.
- Point out that the "issue" tab is missing in forks by default.
- Go to settings and activate the issues, which will be useful to coordinate your work.
- Invite others to open pull requests and contribute to your fork.
